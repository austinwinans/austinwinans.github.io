	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		Hello there! I'm Austin Winans, a high school graduate currently pursuing a BS in Cybersecurity with a focus in Data Analytics at Southern New Hampshire University.

		My journey began in 2015 when I proudly joined the Army, and I am still actively serving. Over the years, I've taken on various roles, including a Patriot Missile Systems Communications Specialist at Fort Bliss, Texas, a Command Post Node Team Chief at Fort Carson, Colorado, a Network Operations NCOIC at Fort Carson, Colorado, and a Recruiter in Concord, New Hampshire.

		My passion for technology has driven me to develop a diverse skill set. From web development to software development in Python, I thrive in working on networking, cybersecurity, telephony, and satellite communications projects.

		My ultimate career goal is to become a red team penetration tester. I'm driven by the challenge of identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing cybersecurity measures to protect critical data and systems.

		With a strong dedication to my craft and an unwavering commitment to professional growth, I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to the world of cybersecurity.

		Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you. Feel free to reach out through my provided contact information.
